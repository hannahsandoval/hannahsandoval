A little about me
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with some of the most innovative companies in the Asia Pacific.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to speak Spanish (well on and off)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her/hers
- âš¡ Fun facts: 
I really am into fantasy novels. I read all the paperbacks of Game of Thrones before it was "cool".
I am into Assassins Creed on PS4. I do not get to play often, but when I do... :knife:
